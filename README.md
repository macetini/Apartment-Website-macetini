# Apartment-Website

PHP + DHTML + SMARTY freelancing project I worked on in 2012. <br />
Originally part of a much greater CMS. Unfortunately, the client abandoned the project.

EDIT: "Project updated to PHP version 8.3 and MariaDB"

The online demo can be accessed at the following URL. <br/>
Using a free hosting service that does not have an SSL certificate.
